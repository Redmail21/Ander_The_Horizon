very basic version done with HUGO, don't regret it, victories are built from mistakes. Things such as blogs and such require more effort in their content rather than the structure of the site. It took me sometime to realize this but i eventually did it. Remember guys, put the effort where it is required and always take the easier/shorter path whenever possible!
