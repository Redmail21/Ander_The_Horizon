# Ander_The_Horizon


Very basic version done with HUGO, don't regret it, victories are built from mistakes.
Things such as blogs require more effort in their content rather than the structure of the site itself.
It took me sometime to realize this but i eventually did it. Remember guys, put the effort where it is required and always take the easier/shorter path whenever possible!

Btw check the new site done with Wordpress and hosted on CloudFlare Pages at anderthehorizon.online !
